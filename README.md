# Simple-Password-Manager
 A simple password manager built using Python and Tkinter that allows you to encrypt, save, and manage passwords securely using Caesar Cipher and Base64 encoding. The encrypted passwords are stored in a binary file and can be retrieved, edited, or deleted as needed.

## Features
- Encrypt passwords using a combination of Caesar Cipher and Base64 encoding.
- Save encrypted passwords with a description.
- View a list of saved passwords with descriptions.
- Edit or delete saved passwords.
- Copy encrypted passwords to the clipboard for easy use.
- Show/Hide password visibility while entering.
- User-friendly interface with Tkinter and themed styling.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

- `tkinter`: for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- `ttkthemes`: for applying modern themes to the interface.
- `pyperclip`: for copying passwords to the clipboard.
- `pickle`: for saving and loading passwords to/from a binary file.

Install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install ttkthemes pyperclip
```
